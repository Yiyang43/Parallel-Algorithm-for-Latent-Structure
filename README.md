# Parallel-Algorithm-for-Latent-Structure

The problem we aim to address is the inefficiency of the algorithm proposed in the paper "Latent Hierarchical Causal Structure Discovery with Rank Constraints". The paper proposes an algorithm to identify the causal structure of a system where some variables are latent and form a hierarchical graph structure to generate the measured variables. The current algorithm in the paper can locate latent variables, determine their cardinalities, and identify the latent hierarchical structure, but its efficiency is limited, and it does not work for large datasets, and can take a significant amount of time to identify the causal structure.

To address this issue, we propose implementing a parallel algorithm to increase the efficiency of the algorithm. We will use previous work to explore three different methods: Vertical Paralellization, Horizontal Parallelization, cuPC. By implementing a parallel algorithm, we aim to reduce the computation time required for the algorithm and make it feasible to analyze larger datasets. Our goal is to improve the efficiency and scalability of the algorithm to handle real-world problems more effectively.
